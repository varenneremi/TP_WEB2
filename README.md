# TP_WEB2
This practical work aims at programming a Web Server over TCP/IP. You will have to design and implement a Web Server able to serve static HTML pages as well as dynamic requests that involve ricmlets. Ricmlets are closed to regular HTTP servlets, just simpler. Ricmlets provide clients with the ability to run Java code, server side, following a well- defined API. To be usable from any browser, your Web Server will follow the specifications of the HTTP protocol. However for time reasons, we will only consider serving the GET requests of the HTTP protocol. As you all know, GET requests allow to get either static pages or dynamic ones, as described below.
